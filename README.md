## Description: A long list of values consist of the letter 'R' followed by a number or the letter 'L' followed by a number

## The Scenario is to imagine a combination lock with numbers ranging 0-99 and it begins pointing at 50

## The script needs to read each line and parse then use a conditional to output a positive or negative number based on R being a decrease and L being an increase

## Then the script will iterate through another loop using the output to increase and decrease using the listed values

- in other words: the script would loop again for each line in the second file, and add the positive or negative value with each loop, and then it should total the number of times that the sum was zero
